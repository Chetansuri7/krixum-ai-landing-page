Perfect. We're aligned.

Final Model Summary:
What You're Building:
"Search, compare, and book platform for local services and products - accessible via traditional UI or conversational AI"
Three Partnership Models:

Model A (Discovery): Redirect to brand apps (quick commerce, some services)
Model B (Booking): Handle booking + escrow, brand fulfills (taxis, aggregators)
Model C (Platform): Full control - listing, booking, payments, guarantees (local providers)

Two Marketplace Modes:

Instant Search & Book: Pre-listed services, compare and book now
Post Requirement: Custom needs, get quotes from providers (Phase 2)

Phased Launch:

Start with categories where you can get APIs/partnerships (taxis first)
Go deep in each category before adding next (not 1-2 services in each)
Add demand marketplace later once core booking proven

AI Layer Positioning:
"Built API-first (MCP-compatible) so AI apps can integrate once and access all local services through conversational interface"

Problem → Current UX → Your Solution Framework:
You can structure each query/use case as a slide:
Slide format:

Query/Need
Current UX (pain)
Your Solution


Example Slides:
Query 1: "I need a taxi to the airport"
Current UX:

Open Ola → check price (₹450)
Open Uber → check price (₹480)
Open Rapido → check price (₹180)
Open Namma Yatri → check price (₹420)
Remember prices, compare mentally, go back to cheapest app

Your Solution:

Search once → see all 4 options with prices and ETAs side-by-side
Book directly through platform with payment protection
Service guaranteed or money back


Query 2: "I want paper clips delivered fast"
Current UX:

Open Blinkit → search "paper clips" (₹45, 12 min)
Open Zepto → search "paper clips" (₹40, 15 min)
Open Swiggy Instamart → search (₹48, 10 min)
Open BBNow → search (not available)
Compare in head, order from one

Your Solution:

Search once → see all quick commerce results with price and delivery time
Click to order on preferred app
Saved 5 minutes of app-hopping


Query 3: "I need a plumber today"
Current UX:

Open Urban Company → not available in my area
Google "plumber near me" → random listings, unclear who's genuine
Call 3-4 numbers → some don't pick up, some overpriced, unsure about quality
Hope for the best

Your Solution:

Search once → see both Urban Company AND local verified plumbers
See ratings, pricing, availability
Book with platform guarantee - payment held until work confirmed
Bad service? Full refund or replacement guaranteed


Query 4: "I need 500 custom printed t-shirts for company event" (Phase 2)
Current UX:

Google vendors, get random listings
Call 5-6 places individually
Wait for quotes over email/phone
Hard to compare proposals
No accountability after order

Your Solution:

Post requirement once with details
Multiple vendors send quotes
Compare proposals in one place
Book with escrow - pay only when delivered and verified
Platform mediates any issues


Query 5: "Find me the cheapest taxi" (AI conversational)
Current UX:

Can't ask ChatGPT/Claude to book a taxi
They can't access real-time pricing
User still has to open apps manually

Your Solution:

Ask AI app integrated with your MCP
AI queries your API → returns live prices from all providers
User confirms → booking flows through your platform
AI completes the task, not just provides information


The AI Layer Angle:
The Gap You're Filling:
"AI apps can answer questions but can't complete actions. We provide the infrastructure layer - one MCP integration gives AI apps the ability to search, compare, and book local services on behalf of users."
Your positioning:

To consumers: "Search and book services - use traditional UI or just tell AI what you need"
To AI apps: "One API integration, infinite local services - from search to transaction"
To investors: "We're the action layer for AI - connecting conversational interfaces to real-world services"


You're Done Defining. Next Steps Would Be:
(Not doing now, but when you're ready):

MVP scope: Which 2-3 categories to launch with (probably taxis + one more)
Tech implementation: Flutter app + backend architecture + API integrations
Go-to-market: Bangalore launch plan, first 100 users strategy
Partnership outreach: Which APIs to prioritize (Ola? Rapido?)
Pitch deck: For fundraising when you have early traction


But for now, the model is crystal clear:
✅ What: Comparison and booking platform
✅ How: Three partnership models, two marketplace modes
✅ Why: Saves time, guarantees service, protects payment
✅ Differentiation: AI-native infrastructure + escrow model
✅ Expansion: Category by category, then demand marketplace
Does this feel complete? Anything else to refine in the model definition?RetryCwell we seem to have decided on all plan related and problem and solution. for revenue, we aim to generate via placement, ads, booking fee, commission fee , marketplace fee and ads related in the app wherever what fee can be applicable. now we will need some data searches to be free like how google has organic search system and show ads to make money. we need to get as much as data even if organic and then show searches and ads as placement, even amazon does similar. we can do sort of say depending on booking, redirect or marketplace . we will charge as per category. with main focus would be to max out on ads from redirect and booking based and commission or Rapido like subscription per month to small per order fee sort of... issue with 20% commission like zomato, ola, uber is high chances of people trying to scam or abuse system to call them directly, rapido and namma yatri fixed this by taking daily fees so no matter what they pay and need not avoid it sort of. can you now make a detailed presentation slides. our brand name is Krixum. you can use kri or krix as some word to solve problem or leave it as is. 
give a awesome tagline which is clear and is small enough . and then 1st slide ideally would be sort of queries and so we decided to fix.. and then do the remaining .. because looking at initial thing investor would be hooked and know what we are trying to do.Show moreKrixum Pitch Deck

Slide 1: Cover
Krixum
Search once. Book anything.
The comparison and booking platform for local services and products

Slide 2: The Problem - App Fatigue
Real queries. Real friction. Every day.
"I need a taxi to the airport"
→ Open 4 apps, check prices, remember mentally, book
"Paper clips, delivered fast"
→ Check Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy, BBNow... which is cheapest?
"Need a plumber today"
→ Urban Company unavailable. Google gives random numbers. Who's reliable?
"500 custom t-shirts for company event"
→ Call vendors individually, wait for quotes, hard to compare
"Find me the cheapest option"
→ AI can't help - it can't search real-time or complete bookings

Slide 3: Why This Happens
India's local services market is fragmented
₹10+ Lakh Crore market split across:

Aggregators (Ola, Urban Company, Zomato)
Quick commerce (Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy)
Individual providers (10M+ plumbers, electricians, tutors)

The result:

Users waste time checking multiple apps
No single place to compare options
Small providers are invisible
AI can answer questions but can't complete tasks

Opportunity: Be the layer that connects everything

Slide 4: The Krixum Solution
One platform. All options. Guaranteed service.
Search & Compare:
See all providers (big brands + local) with pricing, ratings, availability
Book with Protection:
Escrow payments, service guarantees, full recourse if issues
Traditional UI or AI:
Use the app directly OR let AI complete tasks via our API
Three ways we work with providers:

Discovery Partners: Redirect to their app (quick commerce)
Booking Partners: We handle booking, they fulfill (taxis, aggregators)
Platform Providers: Full infrastructure for local individuals


Slide 5: How It Works - Example 1
Query: "I need a taxi to the airport"
Today's Experience:
4 apps × 2 min each = 8 minutes wasted
Krixum Experience:
One search, instant comparison:
ProviderPriceETAActionRapido (bike)₹1802 minBook NowNamma Yatri₹4204 minBook NowOla₹4505 minBook NowUber₹4803 minBook Now
User books → payment held → ride completed → money released
Time saved: 7 minutes. Money saved: ₹300.

Slide 6: How It Works - Example 2
Query: "Need a plumber today"
Today's Experience:

Urban Company: Not available in area ❌
Google: Random numbers, unclear credibility
Call 5 plumbers: 2 don't answer, 3 quote different prices
Hope for the best, no recourse if bad

Krixum Experience:

No exposed phone numbers. No spam. Service guaranteed or money back.

Slide 7: The Three Partnership Models
Model A: Discovery Partners
Who: Large brands with own infrastructure (Blinkit, Zepto)
What we do: Show their products, redirect to their app
Revenue: Placement fees, performance ads
Model B: Booking Partners
Who: Brands with APIs (Ola, Uber, Urban Company)
What we do: Handle booking + escrow, they fulfill
Revenue: Platform fee per booking, small commission
Model C: Platform Providers
Who: Individual local providers (plumbers, tutors, photographers)
What we do: Full infrastructure - listing, booking, payments, guarantees
Revenue: 10-20% commission, subscription tiers, verified listing fees

Slide 8: Two Marketplace Modes
Mode 1: Instant Search & Book (Launch)
Pre-listed services with transparent pricing

Taxis, home services, quick commerce
Compare → Book → Done

Mode 2: Post Requirement & Get Quotes (Phase 2)
Custom needs, multiple providers bid

Interior design, B2B orders, specialized work
Post → Review proposals → Select provider

Same infrastructure. Different discovery mechanisms.

Slide 9: The AI Layer Advantage
Built for the conversational future
Today: AI can answer but can't act

"Find me a plumber" → ChatGPT gives generic advice
User still opens multiple apps manually

With Krixum:

AI apps integrate our MCP (Model Context Protocol)
One API = access to all local services
"Book cheapest taxi" → AI searches live, books, confirms

We become the action layer for every AI app
Distribution: Not just our app, but every AI assistant using our infrastructure

Slide 10: Why We Win - The Moat
Network Effects:
More providers → better for users → more users → more providers
Data Moat:
Structured, verified, AI-optimized service data that compounds
Escrow + Guarantee Model:
Not just discovery (JustDial) or pure aggregation (UrbanClap)

We hold payments
We enforce service standards
We have leverage

API-First Architecture:
Built for distribution through AI apps from day one
Solving CAC for Providers:
Providers pay us, not Google/Meta, because we deliver qualified customers

Slide 11: Market Size
₹10+ Lakh Crore Local Services Market
Addressable segments:

Home services: ₹50,000 Cr (Urban Company ₹2,800 Cr GMV)
Taxis/mobility: ₹1,50,000 Cr (Ola, Uber, Rapido, auto market)
Quick commerce: ₹10,000 Cr (growing 100%+ YoY)
B2B services: ₹3,00,000 Cr+ (IndiaMART ₹1,000 Cr+ revenue)

Current players:

JustDial: ₹800 Cr revenue (phone-era model)
Urban Company: ₹2,800 Cr GMV (single category)
IndiaMART: ₹1,000 Cr+ (B2B only)

Opportunity: Rebuild for mobile + AI era, across all categories

Slide 12: Revenue Model
Multiple Revenue Streams
From Discovery Partners (Model A):

Placement fees for featured listings
Performance ads (pay per click/redirect)
Sponsored search results

From Booking Partners (Model B):

Platform fee per transaction (₹10-50)
Small commission (2-5%)
Premium placement in search

From Platform Providers (Model C):

Transaction commission (10-20%)
Subscription tiers (Basic/Pro/Premium)
Verified badge fees

Philosophy: Maximize ads from redirects, low fees on bookings (avoid Zomato's 20% problem that drives circumvention)
Inspiration: Rapido/Namma Yatri model - daily subscription + small per-order fee = no incentive to bypass

Slide 13: Go-to-Market Strategy
Phase 1: Bangalore Launch (Months 1-6)
Categories:

Taxis (APIs available, proven demand)
Home services (start with Platform Providers)
Quick commerce (redirect model, easy to launch)

Traction goals:

10,000 downloads
1,000 monthly active bookers
50+ Platform Providers onboarded
₹10L GMV/month


Phase 2: Category Expansion (Months 7-12)
Add:

Food delivery
Salons/beauty
Tutors/education
Health services

Scale:

50,000 users
500+ Platform Providers
₹1 Cr GMV/month


Phase 3: Geographic + Demand Marketplace (Year 2)
Expand to: Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune
Add: Post Requirement feature for custom/B2B needs
Target: ₹10 Cr+ monthly GMV

Slide 14: Why Now?
Three macro shifts converging:
1. AI-first interfaces emerging

ChatGPT hit 100M users in 2 months
Every app adding AI chat
Need action infrastructure, not just information

2. Aggregator commission fatigue

Zomato/Swiggy at 20-30% commissions
Restaurants/providers seeking alternatives
Consumers want transparency

3. Mobile-first India at scale

750M+ smartphone users
Digital payments normalized
Ready for unified service layer

JustDial proved the market exists. We're rebuilding it for 2025.
